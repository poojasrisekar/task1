OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION : Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and 
are called properties andmethods, respectively, in the context of an object.
Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
In this sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
