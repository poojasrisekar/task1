HTTP 1.1 - HTTP stands for hyper text transfer protocol was created in 1997 ,because it went through several stages of development,
this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web.
HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. 
A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message

HTTP 2 - HTTP stands for hyper text transfer protocol was created in 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. 
HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not make or does the work.
